# Dosh Fix

![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/InsultingPros/DoshFix/total)

A very minimalistic, serverside mutator that prevents dosh spam related exploits - server lags, server crash, blocking volume bypass, zed kills, etc.

* Dedicated servers work fine since they have `bHighDetail` flag on false by default.
* Listened server - you sick bastard, go install a dedi.
* Solo - just useless.
